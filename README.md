# @ngrx/store with indexed db

This is just a proof of concept for synchronizing @ngrx/store with indexed-db 

- within this example if you would increment the counter and refresh the page the counter should be the same value
- Similarly for the lazy loaded route/feature this should be the case
- It should also synchronize back when you are in another tab and changed to another tab
